A React app to help employees store and filter tickets for rental car agreements.

## Purpose

This app is used to help employees handle batches of rental agreements that have unique problems to be fixed. By storing a list of different tickets and notes that describe what needs to be fixed, the employee saves a lot of time and confusion.

## Tech Stack

Javascript, ReactJS, Express, Local Storage, CSS
 
## Features 

My app has a range of features that help employees navigate through the tickets of interest.

- Create ticket: Create a new ticket with the Rental ID number and important notes.
- Edit ticket: Edit an existing ticket.
- Mark ticket as resolved: Successfully resolve a ticket.
- Delete ticket: Completely remove a ticket from storage.
- Delete all tickets - Completely remove all filtered tickets from storage.
- Filter tickets by status ("Active" or "Resolved")
- Filter tickets by ticket type (Price adjustment, miles, EV charge, or check-in)
